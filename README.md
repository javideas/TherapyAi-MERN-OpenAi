## Description

This is the final project for the Ironhack Spain Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The project consists of a Therapist Simulator with Artificial Intelligence, where the user can interact with an AI therapist to get some guidance and advice. The user can choose from different therapy sessions, and the AI will adapt to the user's answers and emotions to provide the best possible experience.

The project is built with a MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN) stack, and we also implemented OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide the AI chatbot functionality.
